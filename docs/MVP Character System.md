# MVP Character System

## Introduction

This document outlines the MVP version of the character system. In this simplified version, NPCs can gain experience and level up to improve their core stats.

## Character Development & Leveling Up

1.  **Gaining Experience:** Characters gain experience by completing missions.
2.  **Leveling Up:** When a character accumulates enough XP, they reach the next level.
3.  **Stat Upgrades:** Upon leveling up, the player can choose to upgrade one of thecharacter's core combat stats:
    *   Health Points (HP)
    *   Attack Damage
    *   Defense
    *   Accuracy
    *   Movement Speed

This MVP focuses solely on this core progression mechanic, omitting personality traits, communication preferences, and dynamic trait development from the full character system concept.
