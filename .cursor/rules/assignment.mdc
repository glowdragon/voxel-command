# Project Assignment

## Overview
Create a 3D prototype in Unity where two opposing teams of units battle each other on a navmesh. This prototype should demonstrate strategic gameplay elements through unit movement, combat mechanics, and progression systems.

### Core Gameplay Elements

#### Units
- Create two distinct teams (e.g., Red vs Blue)
- Units can be represented as simple 3D objects
- Units must navigate the environment using Unity's NavMesh system
- Implement automatic targeting system where units identify and engage living members of the opposing team
- Combat should only occur when units are within a specified distance threshold

#### Progression System
- Units that successfully eliminate enemy units should "level up"
- Leveled units must gain enhanced capabilities, such as:
  - Improved combat statistics (health, damage output, etc.)
  - Enhanced projectiles or attack mechanisms
  - Visual indication of level/power

#### Player Interaction
- Implement at least one meaningful form of player interaction with the system
- Possible interaction mechanisms include:
  - Strategic command system for units
  - Unit upgrade mechanics
  - Direct control over a specific unit's movement
  - Resource management
  - Deployment of structures or defenses

## Project Deliverables
- Functional Unity project with core mechanics implemented
- Clean, commented code with appropriate design patterns
- README documentation with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Control explanations
  - Design decisions
  - Any third-party assets or packages used

## Evaluation Criteria
- Implementation of all core requirements
- Code quality and organization
- Gameplay balance and engagement
- Creative extensions beyond the base requirements
- Technical performance and stability

# Creative Extension - LLM Integration

As an innovative enhancement to the base project, consider implementing an LLM (Large Language Model) integration that allows for natural language interaction within the game. This would enable players to:

- Issue complex commands to units through text prompts
- Examples:
  - "Form a defensive perimeter around the central objective"
  - "Send half my forces to flank from the east"
  - "Focus fire on the highest-level enemy unit"

The LLM would interpret these natural language instructions and translate them into appropriate game actions, creating a unique command interface beyond traditional RTS controls.
